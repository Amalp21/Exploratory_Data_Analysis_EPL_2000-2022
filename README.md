The English Premier League (EPL) is the top professional football league in England and one of the most widely watched leagues globally. It consists of 20 teams that compete in a round-robin format, where each team plays every other team twice (once at home and once away). This results in a total of 380 matches per season, calculated as [teams * (teams - 1)], i.e., 20 * 19 = 380. Teams earn 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and 0 points for a loss, and the team with the most points at the end of the season is crowned the EPL champion. 

My dataset contains data for every match from the 2000-01 season to the 2021-22 season. In this project, I will perform exploratory data analysis and identify interesting trends to answer specific questions using Python.

**Project tasks**
1) What Team committed the most fouls?
2) What is the distribution of the features of the game? Are there outliers?
3) For a team winning at half time, how does it change at full time?
4) Does the number of red cards a team receives have an effect on its probability of winning a game?
5) Win/Loss ratio by teams
6) Total goals per season
7) Biggest Rivalries
